 First Circle Exam Utility (HTML, CSS, JS)

The following web application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was used for the structure of the webpage while CSS was used for styling the buttons, table, and the aesthetic of the webpage. JavaScript was used for the backend as it included the functions for fetching the API URL and for the functionality of the frontend buttons such as downloading for JSON and CSV as well as printing to the browser's console. 

To access the utility:

You will need:
1. Visual Studio Code
2. NodeJS and its dependencies
3. Live Server (VS Code Package)

NodeJS was used to run a local server and access the API URL, while the Live Server Package was used for viewing the web page itself while implementing the frontend code.

Upon installing the needed dependencies, I prepared a folder for the font that I wanted to use and imported it to the directory of the project.

I started working on the HTML structure so that I can setup the buttons, table, headers, and initial structure of the page. Once done, I worked on the backend task and assigned functions to the buttons for download and print. The fetch function was then implemented and integrated with the API URL and it was incorporated with a for loop structure so that I can fetch data from the URL 15 times as needed. The fetched data was passed to the frontend for table display and to complete the function of the buttons.

Lastly, the design of the webpage was implemented through CSS to enhance the user experience and to display the data with clarity.
